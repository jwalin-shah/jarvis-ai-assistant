And whenever I try to think about it now it just makes my head hurt cause I can't remember. \nRight now we're starting with working on near and far sightedness, so moving back and forth between the two to retrain my eyes and brain how to do it. And we want my eyes to start working together or teaming to take information in. But right now just doing the far and near exercises since I'm not able to do the teaming exercises properly.\nYeah that's true, and I know that. It's in so many of the books I've read. And I used to live like that. But with this it's definitely better. I'm more at peace I guess with where I am and where I might get too. But I don't know how to fully accept that I might not get better, cause then I feel like I'm giving up or I might as well just lose hope. Not a rational response, but not really one we can control right now. I do have more control over things but it's days like Thursday where I just lose control of everything, I can't do anything at all that just make it worse. But it's an ongoing process and I took Thursday a lot better then I would have 2 months ago. So just have to slowly change.

Just digging roots deeper in and growing them. Have to cut those away and think positively to try and get the thoughts we want to take root. And by focusing on what I'm grateful for that automatically changes it too what I have not what I don't or can't do.\nYeah I think I was definitely more fearful of not knowing what I want to do before but now it's just a journey to figure it out. Got to have lunch with Vikas today so got to talk to him a bit about that too.\nHow did you choose what you wanted to do?\nI just started but first they were comparing tests from when I first saw Stanford in May to see how I improved. I definitely did and now I'm in the normal range for the balance stuff but right now there having me doing a  gaze stabilization exercise at home. My balance works but since I can't do everything without my head feeling off we can still improve it. When I go next week we're also going to do an exertion test to see where I'm at physically. Not sure exactly what we use that for but the mentioned it can be useful for determining what the ideal heart rate for my cardio is and things like that. \nRight now I'm using a stationary bike at my friend's house. Just doing 30 minutes. But slowly going to try to get back into running, moving, maybe swimming but I don't think I'm gonna get a gym membership right now. I want to run but because of my hips and back gotta take that easy and ease into it cause need to strengthen it a lot.

I think the bigger issue is I just don't care right now. \nI signed up for classes to take this summer calc and cs which will be hard. And figured out the plan for fall and moving forward. \nBut part of me especially at night just thinks what if I can't do it. I want to get an A and excel at it but what if I can't.\nAnd that's the issue is I haven't accepted where I'm at and been ok with that. And that's why I get angry  and everything kind of stems from there. I actually stopped getting angry. I don't know exactly what helped but reading and just talking it out and time something clicked and now I just don't care about it anymore. It happened it sucked I wish it hadn't. But just move on.\nI'm gonna try a new therapist this week I'll ask about that if I remember. Cause therapy hasn't not helped but it doesn't really feel like it's going anywhere.\nWe play fortnite together mostly so that way we can run cross-platform", "label": "DECLINE"}
