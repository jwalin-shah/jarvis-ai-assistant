His defense is the concern, but there could be a lot that was being held back by being on a bad team.

You improve your defense quite a bit, and your offense can improve as well. But if you want to built towards a contending team, then this is a mistake in my eyes. One, you gave up financial flexibility. So many teams are being held up because of bad decisions they made early on.
