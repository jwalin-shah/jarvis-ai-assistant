What happened already happened now I just need to get past it somehow but it'll also probably just take time I got back this past Saturday. Yeah I can but the issue is I just don't have the willpower to do it. I've been doing my cardio and exercises but aside from that nothing. And my sleeps horrible again like 4am again. I think that's where it made sense when I was still in Dallas cause being there was what I liked and knew I needed to do, but now being at home I'm just like the classes aren't gonna be helping me at all. And if I withdraw I could get back the scholarship for the semester but that's also just me trying to rationalize what I want. But that's where I thought in a couple weeks I'd be back to wanting to do them. Cause to stay in Dallas I had to do then but now that's gone and I just don't care. So that reason is gone. And just not getting to see people and do things doesn't help either but it is what it is. Oh ok that makes sense, do you have to go in person to do your work? Or can you do it just as well from home? Have you gotten a chance to read anything lately?",
    "is_from_me": true,
    "context_prev": "510902|me|Yeah unfortunately now those appts are cancelled and same here at home so imma just have to keep doing exercises. But won't be able to see anyone. It's just different books like Plato then descartes then Emerson and 2 others. An intro course. I was just letting him know I'm not gonna get him a doctors note cause I don't think he needs one, and it's not in the syllabus or anything but he just went on a power trip and said I'd be absent everyday if I wore the glasses without a note. And I was trying to pick a fight I can't win and making things worse for myself. And I wasn't gonna let him bully me cause he was completely in the wrong. But now I'm not actually gonna get the apology and Idek if I would have done it even if we didn't have to leave campus and go online so that doesn't help. I ended up coming home, I can push myself it's just here there's no external pressure to do it. I'm at home so I don't have to do anything and that means I won't. Like I want to just withdraw now cause doing these 3 classes online isn't even gonna help me get better. And I can say I'll do cs myself or something but there's nothing to hold me accountable but I don't care about the classes either. So idk what to do. Being home def hasn't helped and not being able to hang out w ppl or anything. Yeah we got the message. How have you been affected by everything! || 510823|them|Yea that's tough. Coronavirus is no good. Yeaa that's pretty messed up of him esp if you told him the reason. That guy is ridiculous. But no need to dwell on it...just move past it because it doesn't matter at this point. Yea everything has really changed. When did you get back? Well I mean you still can push yourself to do more if that's what is needed...it just requires more will power on your own. And your doctor said it, there's no point in withdrawing because you'll have to go through all this one way or another right? So might as well get it done now. It's been pretty weird being at home so much. But our company got exempted and is considered essential business so we're allowed to be at work. So I've been coming in just a bit later than usual. Took one day at home while they figured it out but yea lol",
    "context_next": "510252|them|what is the reason your sleep got worse? Maybe it's because of the time change or something? || 510266|them|right i mean it's also an opportunity here to realize that you still have to do that. keep the same mentality that you had there but over here. i mean texas is starting to shut down as it is too so i mean you have to pull out that motivation as much as you can. right, I do think there's some rationalizing happening here too. if there's no real negative impact on you continuing with your school as normal, then it seems that the other subtle obstacles (will power, want, etc) are things you will have to overcome no matter when it is..whether that be now or next semester. And, you're past halfway through the semester too so i mean you are close. yea not seeing people sucks for sure and there's nothing we can do about that. but calling, video chatting, etc all should be done if possible. yea i have to go in person because it's mostly classified. so we can't access that stuff at home. yea i just finished reading a book called \"living in a mindful universe\" by Eben Alexander. It's about the author, who is a neurosurgeon, who had this meningo-encephilitis and was in a coma and was basically guaranteed to die. he didn't and he recovered completely. and the experiences he had in that state and his search for something beyond this purely materialistic (using that word technically). it's an interesting read for sure..you may enjoy it. might be worth taking a look at online to see if it's something you'd like",
