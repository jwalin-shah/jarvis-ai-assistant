What happened already happened now I just need to get past it somehow but it'll also probably just take time I got back this past Saturday. Yeah I can but the issue is I just don't have the willpower to do it. I've been doing my cardio and exercises but aside from that nothing. And my sleeps horrible again like 4am again. I think that's where it made sense when I was still in Dallas cause being there was what I liked and knew I needed to do, but now being at home I'm just like the classes aren't gonna be helping me at all. And if I withdraw I could get back the scholarship for the semester but that's also just me trying to rationalize what I want. But that's where I thought in a couple weeks I'd be back to wanting to do them. Cause to stay in Dallas I had to do then but now that's gone and I just don't care. So that reason is gone. And just not getting to see people and do things doesn't help either but it is what it is. Oh ok that makes sense, do you have to go in person to do your work? Or can you do it just as well from home? Have you gotten a chance to read anything lately?",

It's just different books like Plato then descartes then Emerson and 2 others. An intro course. I was just letting him know I'm not gonna get him a doctors note cause I don't think he needs one, and it's not in the syllabus or anything but he just went on a power trip and said I'd be absent everyday if I wore the glasses without a note. And I was trying to pick a fight I can't win and making things worse for myself. And I wasn't gonna let him bully me cause he was completely in the wrong. But now I'm not actually gonna get the apology and Idek if I would have done it even if we didn't have to leave campus and go online so that doesn't help. I ended up coming home, I can push myself it's just here there's no external pressure to do it. I'm at home so I don't have to do anything and that means I won't. Like I want to just withdraw now cause doing these 3 classes online isn't even gonna help me get better. And I can say I'll do cs myself or something but there's nothing to hold me accountable but I don't care about the classes either. So idk what to do. Being home def hasn't helped and not being able to hang out w ppl or anything. Yeah we got the message. How have you been affected by everything! || 510823|them|Yea that's tough. Coronavirus is no good. Yeaa that's pretty messed up of him esp if you told him the reason. That guy is ridiculous. But no need to dwell on it...just move past it because it doesn't matter at this point. Yea everything has really changed. When did you get back? Well I mean you still can push yourself to do more if that's what is needed...it just requires more will power on your own. And your doctor said it, there's no point in withdrawing because you'll have to go through all this one way or another right? So might as well get it done now. It's been pretty weird being at home so much. But our company got exempted and is considered essential business so we're allowed to be at work. So I've been coming in just a bit later than usual. Took one day at home while they figured it out but yea lol",
    "context_next": "510252|them|what is the reason your sleep got worse? Maybe it's because of the time change or something? || 510266|them|right i mean it's also an opportunity here to realize that you still have to do that. keep the same mentality that you had there but over here. i mean texas is starting to shut down as it is too so i mean you have to pull out that motivation as much as you can. right, I do think there's some rationalizing happening here too. if there's no real negative impact on you continuing with your school as normal, then it seems that the other subtle obstacles (will power, want, etc) are things you will have to overcome no matter when it is..whether that be now or next semester. And, you're past halfway through the semester too so i mean you are close. yea not seeing people sucks for sure and there's nothing we can do about that. but calling, video chatting, etc all should be done if possible. yea i have to go in person because it's mostly classified. so we can't access that stuff at home. yea i just finished reading a book called \"living in a mindful universe\" by Eben Alexander. It's about the author, who is a neurosurgeon, who had this meningo-encephilitis and was in a coma and was basically guaranteed to die. he didn't and he recovered completely. and the experiences he had in that state and his search for something beyond this purely materialistic (using that word technically). it's an interesting read for sure..you may enjoy it. might be worth taking a look at online to see if it's something you'd like",

I don't take them much at all. I can deal with so I just do, don't want too get addicted or use them as a crutch. Yeah just try as much as I can everyday and control what I can for the most part.

Why'd you skip all of your classes though? Motivation or pain? Haha nice snake game is a fun game. Classic. Yea I think there needs to be a balance between livelihood and doing what you love. Unless a person is 100% committed to X job they love and has nothing else in their life really...doing what you love without thought to the livelihood isn't really easy to do. For me, work is a means to an end...I work such that I can provide for my family and do the things, like in our Karya, that I actually want to spend time doing. So I'll look for the opportunities that allow for that. Engineering is a classical example of that being there. I worry for people who go through college, which is expensive, and major in something that doesn't pay out for them because the debt and all the stuff that goes along with it can easily make it a very difficult life to live regardless if you do what you love. For me, education, spirituality, religion, etc are things that I love but I've found means to express and do something with it outside of it being my job. I teach Sanskrit on the weekends. I am involved in our Karya. I read and meditate every single day without fail...these outlets help me feel fulfilled.",

So it should be a lot of fun haha || 525605|me|Yeah exactly, so I'll see what the doc says and go from there. It was a combination, motivation cause I just didn't wanna make myself go cause I saw no reason. But also physically I do need to be sleeping earlier at least days I have 9am class. I slept for 3 more hours and I def felt better. But the sleep is motivation and how I feel so ig it comes back to that. But yesterday and today I've done everything and more then I would have thought, even though it hurts a lot sometimes. It's just the hope that it will get better, but it's in the back of my head that it just isn't gonna last, cause whenever it hurts I just wanna stop. But I haven't yet so that's good. Yeah, so that's kind of how I saw cs when I chose. For the time and money I'd spend to what I get it would be the best bang for your buck. And it's a means to an end, like you've found these different things to give your life meaning and fulfillment. But since like probably April/may ive questioned that, cause medicine is exciting, in a different way then CS. Kind of like the feeling I get from chess, actual curiosity. But I'm not really sure where that balance should be drawn. I definitely need to explore more what options there are doing something health related in cs and even in health there's so much available. At the same time though I feel like a lot of it might just be in the state of mind that I'm in right now. Just anxiety and worry even though I might not always feel like that. So have to take it with a grain of salt. What have you read lately? And that's great that'll be fun. Gotta watch the niners win",

This document needs to be completed and turned in individually by anyone under the age of 18 or\u00a0anyone not affiliated with a university. Note that participants playing on a club team from another university (ex. a participant above the age of 18 from TCU) would not have to fill out the waiver.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, we need the Captain's Packet for the weekend and a schedule of events for the weekend. This schedule should detail approximately what time each game will start. These documents can be emailed to compsports@utdallas.edu.\u00a0\n\nWe also wanted to give you more information about tents, chairs, and tables. Regarding tents, Woof will have access to one UREC tent to be used as you all please. We will also be providing two additional tents to shade the water provided by the training staff. Please send us a count of how many tables and chairs you all will need for this weekend so that we can work on moving those sites out to the shed.\u00a0\n\nFinally, Woof is scheduled for a shopping spree with Noah tomorrow. Please remember that all items given out to teams must be pre-packaged and boxed up for each team beforehand for food safety reasons.",

It seems that people are kinda doing what they can for their own area and there's not much national guidance for it. So was just curious. But that's pretty long for sure haha.\n\nYea so there's a practice in meditation that's popular right now called mindfulness. That's kind of what you're talking about. The idea is to feel everything and experience everything with a lot of attention and consciousness....ergo you feel more intensely the negative things but that also helps to dissolve it quicker. I would also say that I perceive the ability to do something broken up into two parts: what you can do + external forces. You can't control the latter. So no reason to dwell on the idea that the world can throw stuff at you...because you don't and never will control it. But you can also say that with 100% accuracy that you not trying will absolutely mean that you won't achieve anything. So always keep working at it!\n\nYeaaa I think taking it slowly is a good thing but if there are exercises that help you feel better, of course those should be done.\n\nHaha yea that's basically it. We work requirements a lot for the missile defense system. So what the system should do and how we get it done and then verifying that we actually did do that.",

That's good it's going well and it's the stuff you're able to do now. Yeaa I think that makes sense at a certain level, we also go towards the path of (apparent) least resistance. And you have been out of it for a while...give yourself some time to reset your mind and all that. And then your habits will kick back in and hopefully help eradicate the idea that you don't want to do it anymore. Are you able to do any of the exercises at home? Haha yea we'll definitely come. We came last year during the summer. Not sure what the plan would be this year but hopefully sooner than later! Yeaaa it has been busy. Yea the program I'm on was awarded a while back but the design reviews and next phases are all semi concurrent haha so it feels busier at times. || 527888|me|I honestly have no idea lol. It's weird cause we don't even say like hi or what's up. It was about 45-50 minutes I think. Do you remember what the chintan was cause I'm not entirely sure. For most of that I was having vertigo and not feeling well so just tryna sit there. Yeah that's a really good point. I was talking to one of the youth yesterday and I think that simplified things. Right now I'm just muscling my way through everything, just making myself do it even though I don't feel like it, and it works short term. But life throws stuff at you and then it might not work anymore, which happened to me. But the better solution would be to understand how I feel and change that, much much harder and scary because it probably would involve feeling worse, but that's something to work towards. I am, there mostly just with bands or body weight, I just don't do them. Or even cardio. I should be but I don't want to. Also right now it's just like enough to go to class and try to do all my work, but eventually gotta work that back in too. Yeah hope you come out too. Oh ok that's interesting, I forgot what exactly it is that you do. I remember it being about design and kind of managing the project right, what needs to be done overall and also working on parts of it",

Yeah my therapists have mentioned it before but I'm just not willing to do it. That's what I was really good at before. Like I just didn't let small stuff bother me, and I'd just find other things to do when I didn't feel that good. So I think I was getting the second part of it correct, but it kind of just builds up cause I'm not actually letting myself feel. But that's what I need to work on, cause even now I can just keep making myself do stuff, but there's the disconnect between what I know is right and what I feel. It's also just something that'll take time as frustrating as that is, there is nothing that's gonna change that so just try to accept it and move on. Oh ok I see, so what did you study in school? Mechanical engineering? || 527616|me|Exercises would probably help, but it's just that I gotta actually get to a place where I'll do it cause right now I won't",

Pick his brain as much as you can while you can haha.\r\nOhh that's interesting. Shaking my head would hurt my head. I get like really strong headaches because of motion sickness and shaking my head would definitely trigger it lol.\r\nOh man that's unfortunate. Well one other way of potentially mapping progress could be to see how long it takes for this sort of pain, vertigo, sensitivity to light comes back. Meaning if last year, it'd come back once a week, and now it comes back once every 3 months, then that's still progress. Even though the immediate shows that you have to wait it out until you feel better, the frequency at which that happens has lessened which is good. And beyond that, I could imagine things would be worse off if you didn't do anything so definitely keep that motivation up bro. It's necessary.\r\nHow's the new therapist?",

First gotta go back to school can't even do anything till you've finished a year so when I go back I can start applying. Yeah still haven't gotten them kinda forgot. It's just a matter of actually doing something everyday to work towards that which is hard. Vikas just talked about why he ended up picking medicine and we also talked about bhavferi and yuva Kendra and what goes into it. He knows a lot of stuff too so good to hear his experience and outlook on everything. That's nice tho, kinda the same as Vatsal he knew what he liked and it grew into what he does now even tho the actions changed, what he was good at and enjoyed stayed constant. I basically just shake my head did ETO side and back and forth focusing on looking at something. If you did it it would mess with you too but less then me. So just like exposing me to the symptoms and getting used to it. Yeah it was going good but actually since like last week on Sunday and part of Saturday I've been worse. Symptoms I haven't felt in about 3 months. Vertigo and my head hurting more and hearing noises more and lights worse and stopped driving. Just basically havent done anything but watch Netflix and football really || 550831|me|Just frustrating cause Im back to not being able to do things and can't focus or concentrate much at all. But it's been getting better the last few days but still not doing anything so just kinda sitting around.

So I\u2019m leading this bible study with this girl, she is pretty cute, but I don\u2019t know how to approach the situation. Since we r leading a bible study together, I don\u2019t want to make things awkward (if things go wrong) before the the Bible study ends. I think I should make my move on the last day of the Bible study, but the window is so small that there is basically no room for error. I went to a Christmas party yesterday, and she was there. However, I never found a good opening for some good conversation, so she is definitely not interested in me (not stopping me). She did hug me goodbye when she left, but that was the only direct confrontation we had. Ig the question is, should I make my move earlier?",

Brunson honestly plays like a mini Luka.  Both are methodical drivers who use shiftiness and strength to get to their spots and score/pass. Dinwiddie on the other hand brings another element. He makes really quick decisions, whether is a quick drive after a catch on the weak side, quick swing pass, or burst out of the triple threat. It\u2019s nice to have that dynamic next to the deliberate and methodical Luka. Plus the second year after the ACL injury is when guys usually start to look like themselves again. I think the biggest weakness is the second unit right now. There is talk of Wood coming of the bench to start, and that might be enough to boost them, especially with the return of THJ.

Minnesota made their offense work last year with Vanderbilt lurking in the dunker spot a lot. Gobert can do a bit more. He\u2019s really good at turning your weak side shooters into real threats with his off ball screening. The wolves also haven\u2019t had a real downhill roll man. KAT likes to pop or post up more. Russel and Edwards will have plenty of lob opportunities. But spacing will be off. If I play small, and KAT wants to post me up, I can swarm him, and be pretty effective.
