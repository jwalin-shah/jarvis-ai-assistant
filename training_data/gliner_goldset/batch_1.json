Yea the meditation apps that let your adjust the time you're comfortable with is really nice. One thing to just be weary of is that I realized that when I wanted to increase the time, it felt a lot more difficult than expected. Haha so keep that in mind but don't let it discourage you for sure. How do you take responsibility for things that aren't in your control? Yeaa, that's good you try to avoid them as needed. It takes a lot of strength to do that, so good on you man. What'd you do yesterday all day? Haha yea that's a succinct way to put it",

It's an app with different meditation focusing apps, it's free they have a bunch of different options for everything. I might check it out. But probably start with insight timer just start with 2 minutes everyday and move on from there. yeah that's the gist of it. Hes also about taking responsibility for everything even things that aren't in your control. I have Advil and hydrocodone but I haven't taken either in like a month and a half. I don't take them much at all. I can deal with so I just do, don't want too get addicted or use them as a crutch. Yeah just try as much as I can everyday and control what I can for the most part. I'm feeling good again now just tired from being out all day today.

I could try to add everything but it'll never work. I went to San Jose sports and then hung out with Soham and his friends. Grilled some food and had to leave before they got in the pool. And then went to the Swadhyay program and picnic || 556287|me|And then I did my stuff for the day like reading and chess and Ted talk",

Why'd you skip all of your classes though? Motivation or pain? Haha nice snake game is a fun game. Classic. Yea I think there needs to be a balance between livelihood and doing what you love. Unless a person is 100% committed to X job they love and has nothing else in their life really...doing what you love without thought to the livelihood isn't really easy to do. For me, work is a means to an end...I work such that I can provide for my family and do the things, like in our Karya, that I actually want to spend time doing. So I'll look for the opportunities that allow for that. Engineering is a classical example of that being there. I worry for people who go through college, which is expensive, and major in something that doesn't pay out for them because the debt and all the stuff that goes along with it can easily make it a very difficult life to live regardless if you do what you love. For me, education, spirituality, religion, etc are things that I love but I've found means to express and do something with it outside of it being my job. I teach Sanskrit on the weekends. I am involved in our Karya. I read and meditate every single day without fail...these outlets help me feel fulfilled.",

So it should be a lot of fun haha || 525605|me|Yeah exactly, so I'll see what the doc says and go from there. It was a combination, motivation cause I just didn't wanna make myself go cause I saw no reason. But also physically I do need to be sleeping earlier at least days I have 9am class. I slept for 3 more hours and I def felt better. But the sleep is motivation and how I feel so ig it comes back to that. But yesterday and today I've done everything and more then I would have thought, even though it hurts a lot sometimes. It's just the hope that it will get better, but it's in the back of my head that it just isn't gonna last, cause whenever it hurts I just wanna stop. But I haven't yet so that's good. Yeah, so that's kind of how I saw cs when I chose. For the time and money I'd spend to what I get it would be the best bang for your buck. And it's a means to an end, like you've found these different things to give your life meaning and fulfillment. But since like probably April/may ive questioned that, cause medicine is exciting, in a different way then CS. Kind of like the feeling I get from chess, actual curiosity. But I'm not really sure where that balance should be drawn. I definitely need to explore more what options there are doing something health related in cs and even in health there's so much available. At the same time though I feel like a lot of it might just be in the state of mind that I'm in right now. Just anxiety and worry even though I might not always feel like that. So have to take it with a grain of salt. What have you read lately? And that's great that'll be fun. Gotta watch the niners win",
