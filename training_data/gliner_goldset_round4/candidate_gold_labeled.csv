Haha na not at all. These chintans at demo aren't part of universal format. It seems that people are kinda doing what they can for their own area and there's not much national guidance for it. So was just curious. But that's pretty long for sure haha.

Yea so there's a practice in meditation that's popular right now called mindfulness. That's kind of what you're talking about. The idea is to feel everything and experience everything with a lot of attention and consciousness....ergo you feel more intensely the negative things but that also helps to dissolve it quicker. I would also say that I perceive the ability to do something broken up into two parts: what you can do + external forces. You can't control the latter. So no reason to dwell on the idea that the world can throw stuff at you...because you don't and never will control it. But you can also say that with 100% accuracy that you not trying will absolutely mean that you won't achieve anything. So always keep working at it!

Yeaaa I think taking it slowly is a good thing but if there are exercises that help you feel better, of course those should be done.

Haha yea that's basically it. We work requirements a lot for the missile defense system. So what the system should do and how we get it done and then verifying that we actually did do that.","527792|them|Nice a quiet roommate is good lol. What is he studying? How long was his Chintan? Ohhh okay nice that's good! That's good it's going well and it's the stuff you're able to do now. Yeaa I think that makes sense at a certain level, we also go towards the path of (apparent) least resistance. And you have been out of it for a while...give yourself some time to reset your mind and all that. And then your habits will kick back in and hopefully help eradicate the idea that you don't want to do it anymore. Are you able to do any of the exercises at home? Haha yea we'll definitely come. We came last year during the summer. Not sure what the plan would be this year but hopefully sooner than later! Yeaaa it has been busy. Yea the program I'm on was awarded a while back but the design reviews and next phases are all semi concurrent haha so it feels busier at times. || 527888|me|I honestly have no idea lol. It's weird cause we don't even say like hi or what's up. It was about 45-50 minutes I think. Do you remember what the chintan was cause I'm not entirely sure. For most of that I was having vertigo and not feeling well so just tryna sit there. Yeah that's a really good point. I was talking to one of the youth yesterday and I think that simplified things. Right now I'm just muscling my way through everything, just making myself do it even though I don't feel like it, and it works short term. But life throws stuff at you and then it might not work anymore, which happened to me. But the better solution would be to understand how I feel and change that, much much harder and scary because it probably would involve feeling worse, but that's something to work towards. I am, there mostly just with bands or body weight, I just don't do them. Or even cardio. I should be but I don't want to. Also right now it's just like enough to go to class and try to do all my work, but eventually gotta work that back in too. Yeah hope you come out too. Oh ok that's interesting, I forgot what exactly it is that you do. I remember it being about design and kind of managing the project right, what needs to be done overall and also working on parts of it","527644|me|Yeah it is, but it's fine. He's white. Oh ok I actually didn't know that. It might have been shorter but I actually got no idea, I was just out of it. Yeah my therapists have mentioned it before but I'm just not willing to do it. That's what I was really good at before. Like I just didn't let small stuff bother me, and I'd just find other things to do when I didn't feel that good. So I think I was getting the second part of it correct, but it kind of just builds up cause I'm not actually letting myself feel. But that's what I need to work on, cause even now I can just keep making myself do stuff, but there's the disconnect between what I know is right and what I feel. It's also just something that'll take time as frustrating as that is, there is nothing that's gonna change that so just try to accept it and move on. Oh ok I see, so what did you study in school?

Yeaaa man Vikas knows so much stuff man. We're lucky he's out here for the year. Pick his brain as much as you can while you can haha.
Ohh that's interesting. Shaking my head would hurt my head. I get like really strong headaches because of motion sickness and shaking my head would definitely trigger it lol.
Oh man that's unfortunate. Well one other way of potentially mapping progress could be to see how long it takes for this sort of pain, vertigo, sensitivity to light comes back. Meaning if last year, it'd come back once a week, and now it comes back once every 3 months, then that's still progress. Even though the immediate shows that you have to wait it out until you feel better, the frequency at which that happens has lessened which is good. And beyond that, I could imagine things would be worse off if you didn't do anything so definitely keep that motivation up bro. It's necessary.
How's the new therapist?","550795|me|Yeah if I do I would go somewhere in Europe so I dont think that would be too much of a problem. But it's just something to worry about another day. First gotta go back to school can't even do anything till you've finished a year so when I go back I can start applying. Yeah still haven't gotten them kinda forgot. It's just a matter of actually doing something everyday to work towards that which is hard. Vikas just talked about why he ended up picking medicine and we also talked about bhavferi and yuva Kendra and what goes into it. He knows a lot of stuff too so good to hear his experience and outlook on everything. That's nice tho, kinda the same as Vatsal he knew what he liked and it grew into what he does now even tho the actions changed, what he was good at and enjoyed stayed constant. I basically just shake my head did ETO side and back and forth focusing on looking at something. If you did it it would mess with you too but less then me. So just like exposing me to the symptoms and getting used to it. Yeah it was going good but actually since like last week on Sunday and part of Saturday I've been worse. Symptoms I haven't felt in about 3 months. Vertigo and my head hurting more and hearing noises more and lights worse and stopped driving.

Like the Mavs really started to turn it around when they had at least two of Luka, Dinwiddie, Brunson on the floor. Brunson honestly plays like a mini Luka.  Both are methodical drivers who use shiftiness and strength to get to their spots and score/pass. Dinwiddie on the other hand brings another element. He makes really quick decisions, whether is a quick drive after a catch on the weak side, quick swing pass, or burst out of the triple threat. It’s nice to have that dynamic next to the deliberate and methodical Luka. Plus the second year after the ACL injury is when guys usually start to look like themselves again. I think the biggest weakness is the second unit right now. There is talk of Wood coming of the bench to start, and that might be enough to boost them, especially with the return of THJ.

Minnesota made their offense work last year with Vanderbilt lurking in the dunker spot a lot. Gobert can do a bit more. He’s really good at turning your weak side shooters into real threats with his off ball screening. The wolves also haven’t had a real downhill roll man. KAT likes to pop or post up more. Russel and Edwards will have plenty of lob opportunities. But spacing will be off. If I play small, and KAT wants to post me up, I can swarm him, and be pretty effective.
