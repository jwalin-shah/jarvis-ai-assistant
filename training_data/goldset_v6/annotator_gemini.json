If withdrawal occurs, what protections are in place for the client, including assistance with transition to new counsel and confirmation that no fees are owed beyond reimbursable costs already advanced?     2.    Costs & Expenses: How are litigation costs handled? Does the firm advance costs, and if there is no recovery, is the client still responsible for those costs? Are there caps or client approval requirements for significant expenses such as expert witnesses or depositions?     3.    Contingency Fee Triggers: How does your contingency percentage change, if at all, after filing? Are any increases tied to substantive litigation milestones (e.g., depositions, expert retention, trial preparation) rather than the passage of time?     4.    Early Resolution: If the matter resolves early or requires minimal litigation, is there a reduced or stepped contingency fee?     5.    Fee Calculation: Are contingency fees calculated on gross recovery or net recovery after costs?",
